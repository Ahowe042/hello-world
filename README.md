# hello-world
The beginning of MY git!

Although I have some experience with Source Control, I am basically brand new to the world of git. I will be using git as a development tool to help me brush up on my development skills, and to ultimately help secure a software developer position.

I am ecstatic to be graduating with a bachelor's degree this sprint/summer!
